- Edith Puclla @EditPuclla
- Shala Warner @Gifted Lane

## Spend considerations

AWS Bills => check every week
Free Tier => Services usage tracking
Gitpod Billing => monitor credits

## Last Week

- Architectural designs
- AWS CLI
- Billing Alarm
- Budget

## New week

- Create new branch week-1 from week-0
- Gitpod start with AWS CLI already installed
- We will containerize apps => more portable, no configuration in environments, easier deployment on multiple environments
- linuxserver.io = multiple images
- dockerhub = registry from docker images (host own images free)
- There are others
- Open Container Initiative (OCI), docker is part of it
- Docker Hub ~= github for docker images
- JFrog Artifactory, more for artifacts
- Install VSCode docker extension => easy to work in docker
